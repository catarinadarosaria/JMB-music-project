            <h2>Who is José Mário Branco?</h2>
            <p>
              José Mário Branco was born in Porto, the son of primary school
              teachers, and became politically involved in the early 1960s. This
              political activity during the dictatorship in Portugal and his
              opposition to the colonial war led him to seek exile in France in
              1963. There he would eventually meet and collaborate with
              musicians such as Sérgio Godinho and Zeca Afonso, whose records he
              produced and recorded at the Château d'Hérouville studios. After
              the 1974 revolution Branco returned to Portugal and was the
              founder of the music ensemble GAC - Grupo de Acção Cultural. He
              composed a number of music scores for theatre plays. Branco died
              of a stroke on 19 November 2019 at the age of 77.
